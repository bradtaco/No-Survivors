# GameOff2024

## Game Design Document (GDD)

### Game Title:
**(TBD)**  
*Team Input Needed:* Do we have ideas for a title that hints at covert operations, secrets, or shadowy contracts?

---

## Game Overview

### Concept  
The player accepts “jobs” that involve exploring hostile levels filled with enemies, secret paths, and loot caches. Using a combination of stealth and action, the player completes specific objectives per level, such as reaching certain areas, acquiring loot, or causing chaos.

### Genre  
Top-down action with stealth and exploration elements, inspired by games like *Hotline Miami*.

### Platform  
PC and web browsers (itch.io).

### Theme Interpretation  
Each job and level is designed around the idea of “secrets,” with hidden areas, objectives, and interactive elements that allow players to choose how they approach their mission.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Mechanics

- **Job Selection:**  
  Players choose from multiple job offers via in-game “emails,” each with different objectives and rewards.
  
- **Level Objectives:**  
  Level creators can set the main goal as reaching a specific area, destroying items, eliminating enemies, or retrieving loot.  
  *Team Input Needed:* Should we allow players to have multiple simultaneous objectives, or is one main objective per level ideal?

- **Secret Paths & Interactions:**  
  Levels include hidden rooms, breakable walls, or destructible items to encourage exploration.

- **Time Limit (Optional):**  
  To add intensity, levels can have a countdown timer.  
  *Team Input Needed:* Should the timer be a core mechanic, or used only in certain scenarios?

- **Cheat Mode (Optional Wildcard):**  
  Players can activate invincibility or power-ups by discovering hidden cheat codes in levels.

## Story and Setting

### Story Summary  
Players act as anonymous agents taking on shadowy contracts from mysterious employers. Each mission email provides a vague briefing, hinting at a hidden agenda or secret organization.

### Setting  
Each level can vary, with locations like abandoned warehouses, corporate offices, dark alleys, or underground bunkers.  
*Team Input Needed:* Should the setting stay consistent (e.g., a single city) or vary wildly between levels for diversity?

---

## Art and Sound

### Art Style  
Four-color pixel art inspired by retro games. Simple animations for character movement and actions, with a focus on clarity in visual feedback for attacks, item pickups, and stealth.

### Sound Design
- **Ambient Music:** Creates tension with subtle, eerie background tracks.
- **Sound Effects:** Emphasis on footstep sounds, gunfire, item collection, and doors opening.  
  *Team Input Needed:* Do we have an art style preference (e.g., gritty vs. clean pixel art)? Should we add a composer or go with royalty-free tracks?

---

## Technical Requirements

### Development Tools
- **Game Engine:** Unity or Godot (for ease of building a level editor and quick level iteration).
- **Level Editor:** Create a built-in level editor to allow team members and players to craft new stages.

### Source Control
- **GitHub Repository:** For code and asset collaboration, with a folder structure for level files and assets.  
  *Team Input Needed:* Which engine are we most comfortable with for building an editor?

## Questions for the Team

1. **Title:** Any title ideas to capture the theme of secrets and covert missions?
2. **Objectives:** Should we focus on one objective per level, or allow complex, multi-objective missions?
3. **Timer Mechanics:** Should we make time limits core to the game or only in select levels?
4. **Setting Consistency:** Should the levels remain within a cohesive setting or vary by mission?
5. **Engine Selection:** Are we leaning towards Unity or Godot for ease of use with the level editor?

## **Concept**

### **Gameplay Overview**  
Players control a former special forces operator turned drifter, embarking on shadowy missions to dismantle a criminal empire. Success depends on scavenging resources, adapting to dynamic situations, and manipulating the volatile underworld economy.

   Breakable walls, furniture, and objects create dynamic combat and exploration opportunities.  

2. **Collateral Damage Bonuses**  
   Players earn rewards for causing chaos, provided they stay within mission-specific limits.  

3. **Emergent Rivalries**  
   NPCs react dynamically to player actions, escalating missions or complicating future encounters.

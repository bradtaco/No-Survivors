## Game Design Document (GDD)

### Game Title
**Bargain Hunters**  
*Premise*: In the gritty underworld of the Bargain Basement black market, players scramble for deals, eliminate competition, and influence the market as they accept shadowy contracts. In this dystopian world, each action has an impact—from raising the cost of fuel to auctioning rare items.

## Game Overview

### Concept
Players navigate a chaotic, dangerous black market where each job influences the economy and resources. They can take on missions, collect items, and eliminate rivals to gain an advantage, all while operating within a dynamic market system that rewards strategic choices.

### Genre
Top-down action game with strategy and exploration elements, inspired by classic games like *Hotline Miami* but with a satirical, chaotic market economy twist.

### Platform
PC and web browsers (itch.io).

### Theme Interpretation
The game revolves around “bargains,” where every action affects item availability and pricing. Through random market events and destructive missions, players gain more influence over the market and their reputation.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Mechanics

- **Job Selection**  
  Players pick from various job offers, each with unique objectives and rewards that impact the game world, market prices, and available items.

- **Randomized Market**  
  Weapons and items are available at fluctuating prices. Players can impact the prices by manipulating the economy through their choices.

- **Market Influence Missions**  
  Missions allow players to change prices. For example, destroying fuel supplies raises gas costs, or eliminating supply chains can make certain items scarce.

- **Instacart Mode (Collection Missions)**  
  Players receive a “shopping list” of items to collect. Completing these missions unlocks rewards or special items on the market.

- **Auction Mechanics**  
  Some rare items are only available at auctions, requiring players to compete or even sabotage rivals to win prized possessions.

- **Punch Card Rewards**  
  Players earn a power-up after a set number of items or kills, offering more abilities and advantages as they progress.

- **Time-Limited Objectives**  
  Some jobs require completing tasks within a time limit, creating urgency and the option to eliminate competition along the way.

### Story and Setting

- **Story Summary**  
  The protagonist, known as *The Saint*, is an ex-priest turned vigilante enforcer in a dystopian city. Guided by cryptic mission emails, they strive to "cleanse" the city of corruption, one job at a time, each action rippling through the market.

- **Setting**  
  Levels take place in various dark environments: black market hubs, abandoned warehouses, auction houses, and gritty alleys. Each location reflects a dangerous, chaotic urban landscape with hidden rooms, destructible items, and NPCs.

## Art and Sound

### Art Style
Four-color pixel art for a gritty, retro aesthetic. Environments and characters are minimalistic but expressive, with key details on muscle-bound NPCs, shady characters, and rough urban settings.

### Sound Design
- **Ambient Music**: Dark, rhythmic tunes fitting the intense, underground vibe.
- **Sound Effects**: Footsteps, gunfire, item pickups, and object destruction for immersive feedback.

### Technical Requirements

- **Development Tools**
  - **Game Engine**: Clickteam Fusion, chosen for fast level editing and asset integration.
  - **Level Editor**: Built-in editor for streamlined level design, making it easy for team members to place assets and test gameplay.
  - **Aseprite for Assets**: Assets and animations will be created in Aseprite, with sprite sheets exported for easy loading in Clickteam Fusion.

- **Source Control**
  - **GitHub Repository**: Centralized for code and asset collaboration, with organized folders for sprite sheets, level assets, and audio files.

## Questions for the Team

1. **Market Influence**: How should actions impact item prices? Should every item correlate with specific price effects?
2. **Punch Card System**: Should we have varied rewards (e.g., power-ups, discounts) or keep it simple?
3. **Auction Strategy**: Should killing rivals at auctions trigger “wanted” effects?
4. **Setting Expansion**: Are there additional environments (like VIP markets or secret shops) that could enrich gameplay?
